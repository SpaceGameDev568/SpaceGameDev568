I'm a student in Florida, USA learning Game Development. I am interested in Level Design and Environment Art and I often work on personal projects in Unity to improve my skills. I also work on mods for Satisfactory, Kerbal Space Program, and Surviving Mars in my free time. My various projects include my mods for Satisfactory, my personal Unity projects, and more. I don't have a whole lot of experience in GameDev yet but I am taking courses in Level Design with Unity and I'm also learning basic scripting with C++ and C#.

I also enjoy gaming when I'm not doing GameDev. My favorite games include Subnautica, Planet Coaster, Satisfactory, and Kerbal Space Program. I especially enjoy management games like Planet Coaster and because I can design functional yet good-looking environments while also playing strategically. I also take tons of screenshots. I am also passionate about Spaceflight, If you couldn't already tell from my username. I enjoy Kerbal Space Program a lot too with over 500 hours in it.
