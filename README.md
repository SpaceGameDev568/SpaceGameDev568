About me:

Hi, I'm Jesse, a senior high school student from Charlotte, North Carolina. I am interested in the IT industry and I'm looking to get a career in tech when I graduate. I've been teaching myself programming and network administration in my free time and I have more recently begun taking Google's IT Support Specialist Certificate course in order to prepare myself for an entry-level job in the industry.
